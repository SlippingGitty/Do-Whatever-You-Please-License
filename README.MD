This license was created as a responce to the Do Whatever The F--k You Want license, last updated in [2004](http://www.wtfpl.net/). 

WYPPL aims to be as liberating as WTFPL, whilst maintaining that liberty within subsequent forks of the Software. 

WTFPL requires that one must change the name of the software once forked, and also allows you to remove the license (though not explicitly stated). 

The license also aims to be more "friendly" to those who don't want crude language in their Software license.
