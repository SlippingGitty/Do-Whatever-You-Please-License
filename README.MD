This license was created as a responce to the Do Whatever The F--k You Want license, last updated in [2004](http://www.wtfpl.net/). 

WYPPL aims to be as liberating as WTFPL, whilst maintaining that liberty within subsequent forks of the Software. 

The license also aims to be more "friendly" to those who don't want crude language in their Software license.

__With this license you are permitting the following:__
* Anything (Really, anything!)

__With this license you are restricting the following:__
* Modification of the license
* Sub-licensing

__Why use this over WTFPL?__

WTFPL has a clause that [requries you to change the name of the license if modified, and also allows you to remove the license.](https://tldrlegal.com/license/do-wtf-you-want-to-public-license-v2-(wtfpl-2.0)) Because WYPPL doesn't allow modifications of any kind to the license, this is restricted. 

__Why use this over MIT?__

MIT requires the same restrictions as this license and allows the same permisions. However, MIT also specifies [that the copyright owner is not held liable (in other words, lacks a warranty)](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) for any issues a user or developer may face. This license opens the door for adding your own warranty if deemed necessary.

__Why use this over the Unlicense?__

The Unlicense also [prohibits warranty, on top of allowing one to remove or extend the license.](https://tldrlegal.com/license/unlicense#summary)

__Why did you create this license? Why use this over not having any license at all?__

If you do not want to use a license for your software, that is totally fine! In my personal opinion, sometimes things need to be limited in order to retain freedom. Most specifically, I made this license for personal use, and also just as a creative exercise. I do NOT recommend using this license on anything one might deem important. GPLv3 is nice, but a little *too* extreme for any of my projects, which I don't find important enough to require redistribution of source code. MIT and the Unlicense is nice as well, but I really don't care for any of it's legal mumbo jumbo, even if one might see it as important. WTFPL is what I have used for my projects in the past, and I will continue to use it for those projects as well. But I would really like to make sure that going forward, anyone who may choose to fork my projects will insure the same liberties that WTFPL has.
